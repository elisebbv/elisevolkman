      <p>Jay, a desperate mercenary, has abducted the last living nymph of the province. She’s supposed to be his solution to everything. Instead, he ends up on the run with her and the sister he promised to save with her legendary blood. Jay has to admit that their only option is to return home from exile. He’ll risk imprisonment — or even death — in order to keep them all safe.</p>
      <p>Nym knows she can’t trust Jay even after he saves her from the Nymph-Keeper’s dungeon. She has the scars to prove it. But she has no choice. She must put her trust in her enemies and gamble with her life. It’s the only way to retake control of her own blood and her fate.</p>

        <p>Forest (Nym) has heard of a cure in the southern province of Ether that might save him. She’ll do whatever it takes to prove herself and work toward her goal of healing without nymph blood. Silic, the Etherian-born captain of the guard, is haunted by his past in his homeland. He’ll do anything to keep Forest safe, even if it means putting himself in harm’s way again.</p>
          
        <p>To the west, at the border of Ireece and Galia, Jay is caught up in the battle while fleeing the consequences of his role in the Butcher’s death. As long as his sister Aleah is trapped in Galia, he’ll fight to save her. But Aleah is fully prepared to save herself, no matter the cost.</p>
          
        <p>As secrets unravel and blood is spilled, nymphs and humans are picking sides. Fethens stands in the middle of it all. Can the crown prince unite his people before the whole kingdom falls apart?</p>

          <p>In the final book of The Nymph Keepers, Forest struggles with her duties as court herbalist and the expectations of a future queen. Terryn needs her influence to unite the remaining nymphs under one crown and she needs his power to make a better life for her people. Together, they face the rot creeping across Galia’s borders into Ireece. Forest and Flint are tasked with discovering the cause and the cure — but answers are difficult to find and time is running out.</p>

          <p>In the south, Silic leads the nymphs of the Darkwater against the Herald of the Gods. His heart still belongs to Forest, but his revolutionary ways may lead him too far from her forgiveness. Jay has been captured, and Aleah is suffering the fallout of her alliance with Keelie. They must decide who they’ll save, and who they’ll serve, as their world is forever changed.</p>
