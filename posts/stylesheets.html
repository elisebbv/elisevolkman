      <h3>Style Sheets: the brain saver you didn't know you needed</h3>
      <hr>
      <p><em>January 07, 2021</em></p>
    </div>

  </section>
 
  <div id="post-body">
    <p>You have 40,000 words all typed up in a single document. You've broken your narrative into sections, you've given each chapter a title &mdash; or maybe a number &mdash; and you've plotted out the next several chapters that will get you to that scene you've been dying to write since page 10.</p>
    <p>You stop. You blink at the screen. The cursor blinks back.</p>
    <p>What colour eyes did that character have again?</p>
    <p><i>I'll have to scroll back... When did I introduce them? Did I even describe them?</i></p>
    <p>Luckily, a quick <strong>CTRL-F</strong> will let you find any time that character name was mentioned so that you don't have to scroll back eternally and check each page, but still. How many times do you think you used that character's name in your entire narrative so far?</p>
    <p>Now, maybe you already see the solution to this problem. Maybe you saw the solution before I presented the problem in the first place. Or maybe, like me, you were so caught up in your own way of doing things that you didn't realize there was a better way.</p>
    <p>There is <em>such</em> a better way, and it's called a Style Sheet: a single document separate from your manuscript where you catalogue every relevant "rule" contained within your story.</p>
    <p>This can include everything from character names and descriptions and made up places, to American vs. British spelling and whether or not you've banned the Oxford Comma from ever gracing your pages.</p>
    <p>This is not only to the benefit of the person writing the book, but also to the person editing the book &mdash; assuming two different people are doing these tasks which should be a no-brainer even if I am biased.</p>
    <p>Whether you as an editor have had a client who has bequeathed you with a Style Sheet at the start of a contract or not (<strong>*cue uncontrollable sobbing*</strong>), you know that you need this in your life. How else are you supposed to remember which spelling they use, which punctuation rules they follow, and which grammatical guidelines they shirk in the name of "finding their voice"?</p>
    <p>Some people use grids and tables; some writers like to write in Scrivener and there's a whole system for these things built into the platform; maybe you write yours down by hand. I organize mine in a document as an alphabetical list. For Fiction manuscripts, I'll use headings to break things up: people, places (especially made-up places and their relation to the made-up places around them), important titles and their capitalization rules, and any finnicky spelling and grammar rules that I follow religiously or shirk out of pure spite.</p>
    <p>For non-fiction manuscripts, depending on the genre, not all of the headings are always necessary. Depending on how simple or complex the project is, I might not use headings at all. In that case, I organize each item in an alphatbetical list so that I can easily find what I'm looking for, be it a description of someone or a note about spacing around ellipses.</p>
    <p>Maybe the mere idea of organizing yourself with a list of any kind is enough to make your heart shrivel in horror, but just remember: the point isn't to follow a divinely ordained rule book for how you should structure your style sheet. <strong>The point is to keep organized.</strong> You can do that by figuring out which method works for you personally, and leave the rest to the dogs &mdash; or whoever else finds that crap useful.</p>
