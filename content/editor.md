## What I Offer
Not sure what kind of editing you need? No worries! [Contact me](mailto:elisebbt@gmail.com) and we'll figure it out.

[Copy Editing](#copy-editing)<br>
[Proofreading](#proofreading)

### Free Sample Edit
[Request a free sample edit of your manuscript](mailto:elisebbt@gmail.com) to see if we'll be a good fit! In your email, please include the following: title, genre, a brief summary, and the approximate word count of your project. I enjoy a variety of fiction genres, including fantasy, science-fiction, dystopian, gothic, young adult, and middle grade.

### Manuscript Consultation

A manuscript consultation provides you with a high-level overview of where to focus your story edits.  This is a great budget option for authors who just need a little direction with their draft.

You will receive an Editorial Letter from me, highlighting big-picture feedback about plot, character development, pacing, and the overall narrative structure.

### Developmental Editing

A developmental edit provides you with big-picture feedback; everything from character development and plot structure to style, pacing, and continuity. This is more in-depth than a manuscript consultation and I will offer specific suggestions for rewriting, adding, or removing content as necessary.

You will receive (1) an Editorial Letter from me, outlining the main feedback beats, and (2) a copy of your manuscript with comments and reflections recorded throughout to give more detail to the Editorial Letter.

### Copy Editing

A copy edit provides you with feedback on correctness, accuracy, and consistency. 

You will receive a copy of your manuscript from me with my comments, suggestions, and corrections on grammar, spelling, style, and punctuation. Some suggestions for rewriting or reorganizing may be included, but this will not be the primary focus.

### Proofreading

A proofread is the final editing stage after your book design has been finalized and before your book is published. 

You will receive a PDF of your manuscript with corrections and comments on any remaining errors such as typos, layout issues, or other issues introduced at any point in the writing, editing, or design process.
