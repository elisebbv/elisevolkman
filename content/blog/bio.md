## I'm Elise.

I write fantasy for fun, read fantasy for research, and occasionally fantasize about how many friends I'd have if I got out of the house more. 

I graduated from The Writerâ€™s Studio Online at Simon Fraser University, where I also spent two years as a TA for the inimitable Eileen Cook. When I'm not writing, I work as a [freelance editor](/services/) and co-host [The Tea Grannies Writing Podcast](https://shows.acast.com/the-tea-grannies). I live in British Columbia, Canada with my husband and our eight computers.
