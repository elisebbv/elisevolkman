## Hello. I'm Elise! 

_(Think "FÃ¼r Elise," but more like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6-h1gIwwSI).)_

If you're not familiar with me or my work, this website is a great place to learn more about the magic and monsters in my head. 

I love helping other writers thread a story together, whether that's through the writing group, The Tea Grannies Podcast, or offering editing services to writers across the globe. If you're looking for a high-level discussion of your work, or the nitty-gritty of grammar and punctuation, I would love nothing more than to help you make your project the very best that it can be.

### These are the editing services I provide:

- Developmental Editing
- Copy Editing
- Proofreading

You can read more about them and the genres I enjoy most on my [Editing Services Page](https://elisevolkman.com/editing), where you'll also find my editing portfolio and a couple of testimonials.

I am open to new projects for 2022 and looking forward to getting to know new writers, mature writers, and any writers who find themselves somewhere in between.

Happy writing!
