            I will provide structural and stylistic comments for what’s already working
            in the novel and what needs more work. I’ll look at aspects such as
            character development, plot structure, style, pacing, continuity, and the
            ultimate impact of the story. Some copy edits may be included, but this
            will not be the primary focus.

            I will check written material for grammar, spelling, style, and
            punctuation issues. I may also suggest rewriting some sections, if
            necessary, to fix transitions, wordiness, jargon, and to ensure the
            style of the piece is continuous.
