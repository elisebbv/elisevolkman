I am a freelance editor, and a Web Designer and Communications Coordinator for
a non-profit. I write fantasy for fun, read fantasy for research, and
occasionally fantasize about how many friends I’d have if I got out of the
house more. I graduated from Simon Fraser University’s [The Writer’s Studio
Online](https://www.sfu.ca/continuing-studies/programs/the-writers-studio-creative-writing-certificate/why-this-program.html)
, where I also volunteered as a TA for two years with the inimitable Eileen
Cook.
