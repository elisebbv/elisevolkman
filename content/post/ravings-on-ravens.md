## What have you been reading lately? 

>“One raven for uncertain peril. Six for danger sure to arrive. A dozen for death, if not avoided. The enchantment is sealed.” 

>**_An Enchantment of Ravens_** by Margaret Rogerson

I am guilty of devouring more fantasy novels than real-life experiences, so if you're looking for a well-rounded reading life, you won't find it here. That said, I'm perfectly satisfied with my diet, thank you very much. I branch into science fiction, romance, and contemporary fiction on occasion --- mostly when I'm reading webcomics, but it still counts --- so you can't say I'm a total snob.

Anyways.

## The Review: _An Enchantment of Ravens_

Isobel, a talented painter, meets Rook when he commissions her for a portrait. A portrait of _himself_. If you were wondering how intimate it is to stare at someone for long hours and catalogue every detail of their person in layers of paint… Well, when I say enemies-to-lovers, you can be sure this one is ✨sizzling✨. Not only does this pair embody a Lizzie Bennett x Mr. Darcy level of romantic, but Rook is also one of the fae. Fair Folk. Fairie. Notably, Isobel is NOT, and if you’ve read any S.J. Maas or Holly Black in recent years, you know why that’s already a wonderful source of conflict.

Enchantments, art, a fiercely brave and talented protagonist, and rich and delightful world-building, all rolled up into this beauty. Of all the fae fantasies I’ve read in the past couple of years, Rogerson’s work is thus far my favourite!

Happy reading!
